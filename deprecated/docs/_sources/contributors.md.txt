## Code Management

At this time we recommend and require that you use `pyCharm` community edition
or profesional to edit your code. Before committing we like that you run
`Inspect Code ` on all files that you commit and fix as many errors as possible
including PEP8 format suggestions. It also notifies you of issues you may not
think about while doing other code inspection.

The reason we ask you to do so is that pycharms code inspection is very good,
and that if everyone uses pycharm the format of the code is uinform and we do
not run in to formatting issues.

This will make the review of any code contributed much easier.

Naturally you can use a different editor for your work, but we still ask you to
use pycharm to fix formatting and code inspection before you commit.

Typically we run a code inspection every week.

## Documentation Management

To increase readability of the documentation we ask you to try to use 80
character line limits if possible. This is important for better editing
experience in github. A good editor to do this with is emacs withe its `Esc-q`
command and pycharm with its `Edit-Wrap Line to` column or paragraph features.
On macOS this can be called with `CONTROL-SHIFT-COMMAND-W` or
`CONTROL-SHIFT-COMMAND-P`

## Security Management (needs further investigation if useful and secure)

Some security risks can be shown with

```bash
$ pip install bandit
$ bandit -r ./cloudmesh 
```

## Version Managemt

This is only done by Gregor

To create a development version we say 

```bash
$ make build
```

To increase the patch number, say 

```bash
$ make patch
```

To increase the minor number

```bash
$ make minor
```

The major number will stay to 4, so this is not changed

To create a release say

```bash
$ make release
```

After the release is done the minor number will be increased and the buld number
will be reset.
